To run the solution, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system.  Please download and install it from the official website 
(https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can test the solution by running the test suite with the following command:
python -m unittest test_resist.py

The test suite can be saved to a file named test_resist.py and save it in the same directory as the resist.py script.

The worst-case space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input string network. This is because we use a single stack to keep track of the resistors as we parse the string, and the maximum depth of the stack is proportional to the number of parentheses in the string.
