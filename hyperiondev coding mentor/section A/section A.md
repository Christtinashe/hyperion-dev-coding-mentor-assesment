Positive aspects:

The  code implements a reverse string method using recursion, which is a good approach to the problem.

The  code also prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci series, which makes sense and is a good addition to the problem.

Improvements necessary:

The reverse string method is incorrectly named as "reverse_string" instead of "reverseString" which might lead to unexpected results or error messages if the method is called using the incorrect name.

The code uses a generic unnecesary method for printing the Fibonacci series. The method should be named specifically for its purpose, such as "printFibonacciSeries".
The maximum number of elements in the Fibonacci series is hardcoded in the code, i suggest you  make it an input parameter that can be passed to the method when it's called.
The code does not have adequate documentation or comments explaining the purpose and logic behind the implementation. Adding clear and concise comments would make the code easier to understand and maintain.

Encouraging:
Great job on implementing both the reverse string method and the Fibonacci series in your code. Keep up the good work and keep learning new programming concepts.
