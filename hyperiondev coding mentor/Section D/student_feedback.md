QUESTION

Handling student concerns is an important part of the mentorship role.
In the following scenario, you have provided feedback to a student in a
code review for one of their submissions. After reading the feedback, the
student responds in an irate manner claiming that you have provided
feedback that does not provide any value, is generic and seems like you
copy-pasted feedback just to complete the review. You did in fact provide
non-generic, personalised and actionable feedback. On top of this, the
student has also made a complaint on social media about the poor quality
of your review. Please explain how you would handle this situation.

Answer

the first step is to acknowledge and understand how the student feels

ellaborate on the feedback: Ask the student to specify which parts of the feedback they feel are generic or not actionable. Explain the reasoning behind the feedback and provide specific examples to support your points.
also asking which part of the feedback they feel is generic and not actionable. then explain how and why you got to that feedback is very important

Address the complaint: If the student has made a complaint on social media, it's important to address it as soon as possible. it is very important to let the student know that you are here to help them as best as you can  and help them grow

Offfer further assistance: If the student is still not satisfied with your response, offer to schedule a time to discuss the feedback in more detail and give the student room to voice their concerns regarding the matter

Seek help from seniors: when you are unable to resolve the issue, asking help from a supervisor or a peer mentor who may be able to provide additional insights or suggestions on how to handle the situation.
