Question

Java Support Task
In this task, we will simulate a typical interaction that you might have with
a student during a mentor support call.

The student asks you the following question:
"I am trying to do Task 6 and the JOptionPane.ShowDialog() does not work.
For some reason it does not store the input to the string variable it is
assigned to, so my do-while loop ends up in an infinite loop. Can you please
help me?"
Please describe the process that you would follow to help the student.

Answer

the process to help the student would be:

1- Firstly ask the student to provide a sample of their code,  which should include  the portion that uses JOptionPane.ShowDialog() and the do-while loop.

2- Secondly I would examine the code to see if the student is using the JOptionPane.ShowDialog() method the correct way. Then check if the input received by the JOptionPane.ShowDialog() method is being stored in the appropriate string variable.

3-If the code is using JOptionPane.ShowDialog() correctly, I would then examine the do-while loop to see if it functioning as intended. I would then look for any conditions that might cause the loop to run infinitely, and determine if the input received from JOptionPane.ShowDialog() is affecting the loop in any way.

4- If the issue is found, I would help the student correct their code and explain the reasons for the correction.

5- lastly I would request that the student test their code again to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
